# Digital Clock in Assembly Language

## Description
This project is a simple digital clock implemented in Assembly language. It displays the current time in a digital format, utilizing assembly instructions to control the display and update the time.

## Features
- Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format
- Implemented using Assembly language for low-level control
- Minimalist design for easy understanding

## Requirements
- An environment that supports Assembly language programming (e.g., x86 architecture)
- Appropriate tools for assembling and running Assembly code (e.g., NASM, an emulator or hardware platform)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Assemble the assembly code using a suitable assembler. For example, using NASM:
